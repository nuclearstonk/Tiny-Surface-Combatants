upcoming (in no particular order and not necessarily next update):
ships (whenever ship support is added for the game)

S-300P/PT/PM/PMU/PMU2/V/VM/F/FM/idk man whatever S-300 variants you can think of theres about a bajillion of them
MIM-104A PATRIOT
M1A2/SEP
T-72B/90A/90M

damage/armor system standardization:
armor values range from 0-5
  0= open top/light skinned vehicle with little protection against vehicle grade weapons [ex: M113, BMP-1]
  1= 1st/2nd gen tanks (RHA and spaced armor only) and IFV/APCs with full autocannon protection [ex: T-62, M60A1]
  2= late 2nd/early 3rd gen tanks (NERA composite/ERA on RHA only) with the ability to fully protect against early lightweight AT weapons and early tank cannons [ex: T-72A, M1]
  3= 3rd gen with thick composite arrays or light ERA under composites to defeat good AT weapons such as early ATGMs and mid grade tank cannons [ex: M1IP, T-80B]
  4= introduction of DU/WHA or heavy ERA for great protection against even modern AT weapons [ex: M1A1HA, T-80U]
  5= very modern/very significant protection methods (APS, late cold war super MBT prototype armor arrays, modern armor materials) [ex: M1A2 SEP V3, T-14]

damage values arent standard but what is standard is the inclusion of 'guaranteed damage,' where a non-penetrating hit will still cause some amount of damage to a target, so even heavy armor wont be immune to overwhelming fire
this guaranteed damage is done through minor splash damage with very high splash penetration

place in /Mods/ in your TCA directory, set up spawns in the Island.json yourself cuz im not messing with the arenas
includes many vehicles from varying nations and eras, all with the most accurate specifications i could find, hp and armor pools subject to personal balancing
will include more units in the future with more functionality and documentation
