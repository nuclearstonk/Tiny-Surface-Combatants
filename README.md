Tiny Surface Combatants V0.9 Beta

features in V0.9
M1A2
M1A1HC
Type 90 Kyu-Maru
T-80U
T-55A/AM1
T-80B model and overhaul
T-64B model enhancement
completely new armor/pen/damage system

upcoming (in no particular order and not necessarily next update):
M48 Patton
more soviet SAMs (TOR, Krug, Gladiator/Giant)

pending game feature implementation (currently impossible/poorly implemented with current mechanics):
ships
rocket/missile artillery
gun artillery
SAM radar sets
SAM site command vehicles
soft skinned/logistics/transport vehicles
tactical nuclear weapons (TBMs, nuclear gun artillery)

dependencies: the nuclear warhead FX requires V0.52 or later of Tiny Weapon Shop, so if you care about the nukes you need to get that

damage/armor system standardization:
generally armor/pen goes from 0-40, corresponding with 0mm to 1000mm, but is intentionally fuzzy with implementation so that you can get more balanced results
new information with the tank gun and tank armor system is in the TankShell.json file
