Tiny Surface Combatants V0.82 Beta

features in V0.82
M247 sergeant york
MIM-104 PATRIOT
new HAWK variants
fixed M1A1HA
a whole lot of little tweaks here and there (namely reduction in range for VADS)
medium-heavy gun based AAA are now more effective
nukes with redone range/damage calculations (less blast radius with greater blast damage)

upcoming (in no particular order and not necessarily next update):
M48 Patton
a very special surprise :3

pending game feature implementation (currently impossible with current mechanics):
ships
more soviet SAMs (TOR, Krug, Gladiator/Giant)
rocket artillery
gun artillery

dependencies: the nuclear warhead FX requires V0.52 or later of Tiny Weapon Shop, so if you care about the nukes you need to get that

damage/armor system standardization:
armor values range from 0-5
  0= open top/light skinned vehicle with little protection against vehicle grade weapons [ex: M113, BMP-1]
  1= 1st/2nd gen tanks (RHA and spaced armor only) and IFV/APCs with full autocannon protection [ex: T-62, M60A1]
  2= late 2nd/early 3rd gen tanks (NERA composite/ERA on RHA only) with the ability to fully protect against early lightweight AT weapons and early tank cannons [ex: T-72A, M1]
  3= 3rd gen with thick composite arrays or light ERA under composites to defeat good AT weapons such as early ATGMs and mid grade tank cannons [ex: M1IP, T-80B]
  4= introduction of DU/WHA or heavy ERA for great protection against even modern AT weapons [ex: M1A1HA, T-80U]
  5= very modern/very significant protection methods (APS, late cold war super MBT prototype armor arrays, modern armor materials) [ex: M1A2 SEP V3, T-14]

damage values arent standard but what is standard is the inclusion of 'guaranteed damage,' where a non-penetrating hit will still cause some amount of damage to a target, so even heavy armor wont be immune to overwhelming fire
this guaranteed damage is done through minor splash damage with very high splash penetration

place in /Mods/ in your TCA directory
includes many vehicles from varying nations and eras, all with the most accurate specifications i could find, hp and armor pools subject to personal balancing
will include more units in the future with more functionality and documentation
